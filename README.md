# 3D-Planet-with-Orbiting-Belt-OpenGL
This project visualizes a 3D rotating planet surrounded by a luminous belt, built using OpenGL and GLUT. The planet orbits around a fixed point in space while spinning on its own axis, featuring smooth animations and simple lighting for a visually appealing simulation.

# Requirements
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

C++ Compiler (like g++)

OpenGL libraries

GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

# Features
planet rotation and orbital motion.

3D glowing belt (torus) around the planet.
